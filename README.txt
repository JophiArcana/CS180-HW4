main.ipynb is the only code necessary for things to run. In order to run the notebook, pull the repository and upload the directory into a folder called CS180 on Google Drive, and rename the directory to HW4. It is then sufficient to "Run All" in Colab. I skipped rotation invariance for the feature descriptors, as well as the wavelet transform for feature matching.
